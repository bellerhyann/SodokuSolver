After reading in a file containing a sudoku puzzle, this program will return a solved version of that puzzle to the terminal. 

Bugs: after file is printed out my solved sudoku board is not 
printing out a solved version

My approach: I started with reading in a file
from there I made a prompt, and worked on creating 
an array out of the given file

the next few days I worked on replacing 0s to *s
and creating a proper sudoku board.

A prompt was easy to make to create a barrier

the last three days of working on this project consisted of 
creating a sorting, checking, and solving method. 

On the last night before its due date, I deleted alot and tried to approach my issue with only 
one int array. I was able to print the numbers this way but I was not able to solve the 
board.
